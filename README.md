gif (Goatse infection finder) is a tool that helps Garry's Mod users find infected files that have the 'goatse' virus.

## How-To-Use
* Add path to Garry's Mod addons folder using Browse button (if the program didn't automatically do it for you already).
* _(Optional)_ Hit "Download IDs" to retrieve list of updated workshop IDs from github list hosted on this repo.
* Hit scan and wait for it to list out any infected addons.
* If any addons were found, they will be listed inside the listbox where you can double click on them to open the folder containing the infected file. If nothing was found you are clean!
* The program grabs the latest infected workshop IDs from the infectedAddonIDs.txt on the repo. If you want to request new addons to be added to the list, please request a PR for the changes.

__DON'T FORGET TO UNSUBSCRIBE FROM THE ADDONS IN THE WORKSHOP! THEY WILL RE-DOWNLOAD IF YOU DON'T WHEN YOU OPEN THE GAME AGAIN!__
